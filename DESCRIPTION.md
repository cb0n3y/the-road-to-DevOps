# Repository Description

This repository documents my personal journey from traditional IT Operations (SysAdmin) to modern DevOps practices. It contains hands-on labs, infrastructure automation scripts, monitoring setups, and CI/CD pipelines.

The goal is to:
- Learn modern DevOps tools and workflows
- Practice automation using Vagrant → Ansible → Terraform
- Create a reproducible, modular, and well-documented lab setup
- Build a professional, open-source DevOps portfolio

Everything here is a work in progress and serves as both a learning platform and public portfolio.
