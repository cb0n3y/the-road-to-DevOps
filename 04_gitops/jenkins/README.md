Welcome to **jenkins-pipelines** ‚Äî a personal learning repository where I document my day-by-day progress in mastering **Jenkins Pipelines**.

This repo is intended to be a living knowledge base that grows as I explore Jenkins automation, CI/CD best practices, and pipeline scripting techniques.

# üß© Jenkins ‚Äî GitOps & Automation

This section covers **Jenkins setup, integration, and pipeline design** as part of my DevOps learning path.

For hands-on Jenkins Pipeline experiments and daily progress logs, see my dedicated repo:

## üìö What to Expect

In this repository, you'll find:

- üß™ **Daily learning logs** with code examples and explanations
- üì¶ Jenkins **Pipeline-as-Code** scripts (`Jenkinsfile`)
- üîÑ Declarative and scripted pipeline examples
- üõ†Ô∏è Common CI/CD patterns and real-world use cases
- üßµ Notes on Jenkins plugins, integrations, and DSL usage

## Daily Log Structure

Each day will be organized as a separate folder or markdown file:

```text
jenkins-pipelines/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day-01/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Jenkinsfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day-02/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Jenkinsfile
```

> üìå Each day's folder will include a `README.md` summarizing the concepts learned, and a working `Jenkinsfile` or snippet to demonstrate it.
