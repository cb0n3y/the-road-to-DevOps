Welcome to the **Ops to DevOps** repository! This project documents my journey transitioning from a System Administrator to a DevOps Engineer, showcasing the skills, tools, and projects I've developed along the way.

---

## üß© Current Focus

- Deepening Kubernetes & Helm deployment workflows  
- Building Jenkins pipelines (CI/CD) and GitOps automation  
- Expanding monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana  
- Introducing Terraform and Ansible for IaC  
- Preparing for CKA, CKS, and Azure certifications  

---

## üèÅ Long-Term Goals

- Build a clean, reproducible DevOps lab environment  
- Prepare for certifications (CKA, AZ-104)  
- Showcase end-to-end CI/CD, monitoring, and IaC solutions  
- Follow open-source and GitHub community standards

---

## üìå Topics Covered

- üß± Infrastructure as Code (Vagrant ‚Üí Ansible ‚Üí Terraform)  
- üîç Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana)  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Automation & Configuration  
- üöÄ CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)  
- üì¶ Containerization & Kubernetes

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

This repository is organized into modular learning stages that reflect the DevOps journey ‚Äî from foundational skills to advanced GitOps and monitoring setups.

| Directory | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `00_foundation/` | Linux, Bash, Python, Git, and networking fundamentals. |
| `01_containers/` | Docker basics, images, and Compose examples. |
| `02_kubernetes/` | Core Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, and troubleshooting. |
| `03_infrastructure-as-code/` | Terraform modules and examples for AWS/Azure. |
| `04_gitops/` | GitOps workflows using ArgoCD, FluxCD, and Jenkins pipelines. |
| `05_monitoring-observability/` | Prometheus, Grafana, dashboards, and alerting setups. |
| `06_security/` | RBAC, network policies, secrets management, and CKS prep notes. |
| `07_environments/` | Configs for VAL, PERF, and PROD-like environments. |
| `docs/` | Study plans, learning roadmaps, and certification notes. |

---

## Deployment Strategy

Deployments are managed using Git tags:

- **`vX.Y.Z`**: Deploys to production.
- **`vX.Y.Z-beta`**: Deploys to staging.

Automated pipelines ensure smooth and consistent deployments across environments.
